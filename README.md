## Makefile
The Makefile compiles and links all necessary files into the clusterer executable. 

The input is of the form: ./clusterer "dataset" "-o output file base name" "-k number of clusters" "-bin bin width"

Some examples have been commented out in the Makfile. The main commands include:
* make - compiles files
* make run - runs executable according to specific instruction
* make clean - removes executables
